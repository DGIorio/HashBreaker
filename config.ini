# --- Length Control ---

# Maximum length of the *variable* (brute-forced) part of the string.
# This applies *after* prefix and suffix are accounted for. (Must be >= 0 and <= compiled limit)

# --- Character Set ---
# Character set for brute-forcing
CHARSET = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_01


# --- String Constraints (Optional) ---
# Leave blank or comment out to disable a constraint.

# String must start with this prefix
PREFIX = 

# String must end with this suffix
SUFFIX = 

# String must contain this substring (checked after prefix/suffix)

# --- Performance Tuning ---
# Max results stored on GPU buffer before host clears it
# Increase if you expect frequent matches and see buffer overflow warnings often
# Decrease if GPU memory is constrained
MAX_RESULTS_BUFFER = 4096

# CUDA Threads per Block (typically 128, 256, 512, 1024 - depends on GPU)

# Preferred number of blocks per kernel launch (adjust based on GPU SM count)
# Higher values generally utilize the GPU better, up to a point.
